I'm quite curious about the new realms of the knowledge in my life and always aspire to discover "new worlds" taking the challenge high and low. I'm striving to step into the world of IT, even I have just got only humanitarian background. New knowledge and new language command just will give me the new-scaled scope. My strenghtes are painstacking and attentive work before I meet the flawless and picture-perfect output. I love thinking outside the box; I can deal with multitasking challenges as well as I am able to be resilient, industrious and work with the immense capacity of data Currently I prioritise my learning and training as a JS-developer. My short-term goals are to finish first-grade RSSchool course and to obtain basic and also extended commands of JS, CSS and HTML.<br>
