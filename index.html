    <h3>Self-representing</h3>
    I'm quite curious about the new realms of the knowledge in my 
    life and always aspire to discover "new worlds" taking the 
    challenge high and low. I'm striving to step into 
    the world of IT, even I have just got only humanitarian 
    background. New knowledge and new language command just 
    will give me the new-scaled scope. My strenghtes are 
    painstacking and attentive work before I meet the 
    flawless and picture-perfect output. I love thinking 
    outside the box; I can deal with multitasking challenges 
    as well as I am able to be resilient, industrious and work 
    with the immense capacity of data Currently I prioritise my 
    learning and training as a JS-developer. My short-term 
    goals are to finish first-grade RSSchool course and to 
    obtain basic and also extended commands of JS,

    <h2> Code</h2>
    <p>Given task implied to fix a function that couldn't work 
    properly. As followed then "return" directory was absent 
    in the code, so this caused disfunctioning of the multiply.</p>
    My code is here:<br>
    
    function multiply(a, b){<br>
        return a * b;<br>
    }<br>
    multiply(2,3);
