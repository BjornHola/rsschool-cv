    <h2> Code</h2>
    <p6>Given task implied to fix a function that couldn't work 
    properly.<br> As followed then "return" directory was absent 
    in the code,<br> so this caused disfunctioning of the multiply.</p6>
    My code is here:<br>
    
    function multiply(a, b){<br>
        return a * b;<br>
    }<br>
    multiply(2,3);
